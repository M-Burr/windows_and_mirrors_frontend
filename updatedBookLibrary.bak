Long, long ago, there lived a kind physician. He lived on a mountain in a small Chinese village where he practiced traditional Chinese medicine for all the villagers. On his way home one day, he found an injured sheep, rescued it and brought it home where he nursed the sheep back to life. One evening, after the sheep had been living with the physician for some time, a beast barged into the village, demanding payment of each household in the form of one child. If the villagers refused to hand over their children, the beast would eat everyone! In the blink of an eye, the rescued sheep transforms into a lovely girl, who, with a clever plan, manages to frighten the beast away and keep everyone in the village safe from harm. And so, with one simple act of kindness, an entire village is saved, reminding us that every action, no matter how small, has consequences.	4	8	preschool	8	http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iZ8ErgEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api	fiction

10	1	15	5	This is a very special book with a unique perspective of how an entire family navigates through a transition. We like to have books in our home that celebrate diversity. If your family is similar, this is a must add to your personal library. This book is a very well written and thoughtful story. I read it to my 4 year old who enjoyed it and had lots of questions. Questions are good and it helped her understand that some kids feel different inside. Guess what? This book did not make her feel any differently about herself after we read it. Her take away was that when you love people, it doesn't matter what they look like on the outside.	Simplistic, and stereotyped portrayls of gender may warrent additional discussion with students/children. Overall, great illistrations, attempts at inclusivity, and invites/opens discussion with kids	n/a
11	2	16	5	The illustrations are just magical and very well done. I also really appreciate the representation in the book. You see various skin tones, hair types, and body types! Its also great to NOT see a story where the child only comes to accept themselves AFTER being bullied. This book is pure celebration. Julian is living his best life as is, and thats what kids need to see. Representation doesnt also need to include the child being torn down/bullied. I also appreciate that this book wasnt too long winded. I can get through this with a squirmy 4-5 yr old no problem. I would recommend this book for a preschooler or kindergartener.	n/a	\N
12	3	16	5	As other reviewers have noted, this is one of the few books about boys who go against masculine norms that doesn't spend most of the pages focused on people who oppose or downright bully the boy for his preferences. In fact, there is no time spent on negative feedback. Instead, the boy stays true to himself, shows resourcefulness and creativity and authenticity, and his abuela recognizes it and immediately becomes his ally. It's a beautiful story and the art is mesmerizing. We love and will cherish this book.	n/a	\N
13	4	16	5	This is a gorgeously illustrated picture book with a fantastic, simple story. Julian is a boy who wishes to be a beautiful, flowy-haired, swishy-tailed mermaid. His abuela helps him realize his dream. The end. Adults will recognize that, although Abuela might want to scold Julian for kinda-sorta destroying the house in his quest to become a sea creature, she perhaps recognizes that now is not the moment to chide, but rather to show him her unconditional love and support. I appreciated that nobody in this book tells Julian he can't be a mermaid. So many books about gender-nonconforming children spend too much time focusing on the naysayers. Well, this book is all about Julian and his fabulousness. My 3.5yo son and I both enjoyed reading this book multiple times already, and it's been here for less than 12 hours! Highly recommend.	n/a	\N
14	1	17	5	A valuable addition to the growing library of stories about strong Latina women.	n/a	great for classroom readaloud, or to incorporate into music/circle-time
15	2	18	5	not too many words per page, which is nice when one is dealing with a toddler who loves to turn pages	none!	\N
16	5	20	5	Such a beautifully simple board book. Perfect as a first book for young readers. The illustrations are beautiful and the writing poetic.	no concerns - excellent addition to any collection!	\N
